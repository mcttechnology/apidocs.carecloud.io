title: Troubleshooting and Support
---

Effective troubleshooting and support are essential components of a smooth data synchronization process. To assist users in effectively managing and resolving any issues that might arise, we have established a robust support system through the CareCloud Portal Console.

## Accessing the Portal Console

- **Developer Account**: Once users obtain their developer account, they gain access to the CareCloud Portal Console. This access is a crucial first step in monitoring and managing data synchronization processes.

- **Login Process**: Users can log in to the Portal Console using their developer account credentials. This secure access ensures that only authorized personnel can view and manage the data synchronization processes.

## Monitoring Data Uploads and Updates

- **Overview of Data Transactions**: Within the Portal Console, users can view a comprehensive overview of their data uploads and updates. This feature is designed to give users a clear picture of their data synchronization activities.

- **Logs and Details**: The console provides detailed logs of data transactions. These logs are a valuable resource for understanding the workflow of data synchronization, including the successful updates and areas where issues might have occurred.

## Identifying and Resolving Issues

- **Problem Identification**: The Portal Console is an effective tool for identifying any problems in the data synchronization process. Users can review the logs to pinpoint exactly where and when an issue has occurred.

- **Data Update Issues**: In particular, the console helps in identifying issues related to data updates. By reviewing the logs, users can see which specific data updates encountered problems and understand the nature of these issues.

- **Support and Resolution**: In case of difficulties or uncertainties, users can reach out to the CareCloud support team for further assistance. The support team can guide users in troubleshooting and resolving issues based on the information available in the Portal Console.
