## Introduction

The Claim module is a vital component of the CC4, designed to manage the calculation and administration of subsidy amounts related to each child based on monthly Provider Attendance. This module streamlines the subsidy disbursement process by ensuring accurate computation, allocation, and documentation of subsidy claims. Each month, the Claim module automatically imports attendance data from providers, detailing the number of days and hours each child attended. This data is then processed to determine the precise subsidy amount each child is eligible for, considering factors such as attendance frequency and duration. Additionally, the module supports manual data entry and batch imports, offering flexibility and ease of use for providers. By automating calculations and maintaining detailed records, the Claim module reduces administrative overhead, minimizes errors, and enhances the overall efficiency of the subsidy management process.
